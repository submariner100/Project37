# Project37
www.hackingwithswift.com - Project37 - Game where users have to guess the correct playing card. The game has many misdirections - ie
shifting color gradients, falling stars, cards moving slightly and music has been added. Your friend can tap a card which then flips over
showing the card, whereas you can touch a card and your Apple watch tells you where the correct card is using haptic vibration.
lessons learnt - CAEmitterLayer, CAGradientLayer, @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable, as well as how to create a 3D card 
flip effect using the transition(with:) method. View Controller Containment, addChildViewControoler(), GameplayKit, 
GKRandomSource.sharedRandom(), UITapGestureREcognizer(), CALayer, CAEmitterCell(), CFAbsoluteTime and CFAboluteTimeGetCurrent() method, 
UITouch and also Apple Watch Connectivity.

I recommend all beginners to go through all the projects with hackingwithswift as all these lessons are free.
